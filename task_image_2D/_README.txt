two-dimensional visual servo task

In this task, BECCA can direct its gaze up, down, left, and
right, saccading about an image of a black square on a white
background. It is rewarded for directing it near the center.
The mural is not represented using basic features, but rather
using raw inputs, which BECCA must build into features. See

for a full writeup.

Simulation only.

Both MATLAB and Octave compatible.

Optimal performance is around 0.7 reward per time step.
