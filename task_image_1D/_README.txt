one-dimensional visual servo task

In this task, BECCA can direct its gaze left and right along a
mural. It is rewarded for directing it near the center. The
mural is not represented using basic features, but rather using
raw inputs, which BECCA must build into features. See

http://www.sandia.gov/~brrohre/doc/Rohrer11ImplementedArchitectureFeature.pdf

for a full writeup.

Simulation only.

Both MATLAB and Octave compatible.

Optimal performance is between 0.7 and 0.8 reward per time step.
