One-dimensional grid task with noise

In this task, the agent steps forward and backward along three positions 
on a line. The second position is rewarded (1/2) and the first and third
positions are punished (-1/2). Also, any actions are penalized (-1/10).
It also includes some basic feature inputs 
that are pure noise.

Optimal performance is between 0.3 and 0.35 reward per time step.
