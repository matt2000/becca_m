One-dimensional grid task, multi-step

In this task, the agent steps forward and backward along a
line. The fourth position is rewarded (1/2) and the ninth
position is punished (-1/2).

This is intended to be as similar as possible to the 
one-dimensional grid task, but require multi-step planning for optimal 
behavior.

Optimal performance is between 0.25 and 0.3 reward per time step.
